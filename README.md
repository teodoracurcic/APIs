# Homework 05: Even more APIs

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks completed as part of the [LEDE Program](https://ledeprogram.com) at Columbia University.

## Part One: Geocoding with APIs

Notebook: `01-Geocoding with APIs.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates how to geocode physical addresses using Python and external APIs. It includes:
- Sending API requests
- Parsing JSON responses
- Handling API keys with `python-dotenv`

## Part Two: Weather API 

Notebook: `homework-05-part2.ipynb`

After using WeatherAPI in the previous assignment, this time had to choose between two alternatives: [Tomorrow.io](https://www.tomorrow.io/weather-api/}) and [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/). I chose Tomorrow.io and explained why in the notebook.

The tasks included:
- Requesting current weather and 3-day forecasts
- Printing temperature differences (e.g. “It feels 2 degrees colder”)
- Extracting and comparing maximum temperatures
- Reflecting on ease of use and recommending an API for future tools
- Handling API keys with `python-dotenv`
