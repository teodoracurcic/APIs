# Homework 05: Even more APIs

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks completed as part of the [LEDE Program](https://ledeprogram.com) at Columbia University.

## Part One: Geocoding with APIs

Notebook: `01-Geocoding with APIs.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates how to geocode physical addresses using Python and external APIs. It includes:
- Sending API requests
- Parsing JSON responses
- Handling API keys with `python-dotenv`

## Part Two: Weather API Comparison

Notebook: `homework-05-part2.ipynb`

This notebook compares two alternative weather APIs: [Tomorrow.io](https://www.tomorrow.io/weather-api/) and [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/). It covers:
- Fetching current weather and 3-day forecasts
- Extracting and comparing temperature data
- Evaluating API usability for weather-related tools

## Key Concepts

- Making HTTP requests with `requests`
- Loading environment variables securely
- Parsing and analyzing JSON data
- Comparing API documentation and structure
